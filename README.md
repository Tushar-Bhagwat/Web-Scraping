# Web-Scraping

Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. It involves fetching HTML content from web pages and then parsing it to extract the desired information. Python is a popular programming language for web scraping due to its simplicity and a variety of powerful libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Scrapy.

To perform web scraping using Python and MySQL, you typically follow these steps:

Identify the target website: Determine the website from which you want to scrape data.

Understand the structure of the website: Analyze the HTML structure of the website to identify the elements containing the data you need to scrape.

Choose appropriate libraries: Select Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup or Scrapy to help with parsing HTML content.

Fetch HTML content: Use Python's requests library to fetch the HTML content of the web page.

Parse HTML content: Use BeautifulSoup or other parsing libraries to extract relevant data from the HTML content.

Store data in MySQL database: Establish a connection to your MySQL database using Python's MySQL connector library. Then, create a table in the database to store the scraped data. Insert the extracted data into the MySQL database using SQL queries.

Handle errors and exceptions: Implement error handling to deal with potential issues like network errors, missing HTML elements, or database connection problems.

Schedule scraping tasks (optional): You may want to automate the scraping process by scheduling tasks using libraries like cron or scheduling within your Python code.
